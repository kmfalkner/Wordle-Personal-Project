Wordle_Personal_Project

During the summer of 2023 I learned a new coding language, C#, and decided to do a personal project using what I learned. 

My family loves wordle and all play every day so I decided I wanted to code my own version of it. 

In  this game, you will enter five letter words and the program will output a series of 5 numbers where 0 means the letter is not in the word, 1 means the letter 
is in the word but not in the right place, and 2 means the letter is in the right place.
